# Sobel Edge Detection in Verilog

## Project Overview

This project implements the Sobel edge detection algorithm in Verilog for image processing tasks. The Sobel operator is commonly used to detect edges in images by calculating the gradient magnitude at each pixel. This project provides an opportunity to explore Verilog, digital image processing, and hardware acceleration techniques for image processing.

## Objectives

- Implement the Sobel edge detection algorithm in Verilog.
- Learn the fundamentals of edge detection and digital image processing.
- Gain experience in hardware design and simulation for image processing applications.

## Project Description

The Sobel edge detection algorithm uses two 3x3 convolution kernels to compute the gradient of image intensity at each pixel, highlighting edges in the image. This project involves designing a Verilog module to apply the Sobel operator to grayscale images, producing an edge map based on the computed gradients.

### Sobel Kernels:
- Horizontal kernel (Gx):  
- Vertical kernel (Gy):  


## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Install Siemens Questa for Verilog simulation.
- Define the method for inputting and outputting image data (e.g., simulation files or FPGA I/O).

### Step 2: Understanding the Sobel Operator
- Study the Sobel operator and its two convolution kernels.
- Understand how convolution works to detect edges in an image.

### Step 3: Verilog Module Design
- Define the Verilog module to implement the Sobel operator.
- Design the module to perform convolution and calculate the gradient magnitude.

### Step 4: Testing and Simulation
- Write testbenches to simulate the Sobel edge detection with sample image data.
- Use Siemens Questa for simulation and verify the correctness of the edge detection.

### Step 5: Final Report and Deliverables
- Submit the Verilog code, testbenches, and simulation results.
- Include a final report documenting the design process and challenges encountered.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness and efficiency of the Verilog implementation.
- Quality of documentation and final report.
- Creativity in problem-solving and optimizations.
